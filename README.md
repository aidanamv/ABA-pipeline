# ABA-pipeline

This repository is used as a part of atlas-based analysis (ABA) pipeline, particularly as a statistical analysis part. Once all the brain scans were normalized and the average values within every regions-of-interests defined by Allen mouse brain atlas were computed, this script was run to perform t-tests.
